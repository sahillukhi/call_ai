# ROOMAN - AI Voice Assistant for Meeting Management

This is just a miniature version of my actual project where I have solely built enterprise-level project's backend (the whole Python part). It uses different telephony services for voice calls and also has a feature for web calls where users can just copy the provided link and paste it on their website, and our agent will act as their website's assistant. We developed tools which can scrape your site to create a knowledge base, and tools to write your prompts for your use case and industry. We integrated tools such as Gmail, Database, WhatsApp, Telegram, Slack, and SMS for different use cases. This solution can be used as pay-as-you-go for any single user (B2B) or for any organizations where they want to create their entire workforce.

## Overview

ROOMAN is an intelligent AI voice assistant designed to help users manage their schedules and meetings efficiently through natural voice conversations. Built on Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash Live Preview model, it provides real-time voice interaction with advanced calendar management capabilities.

## What ROOMAN Does

ROOMAN serves as a **Meeting Assistant Pro** that helps users:
- **Schedule meetings** with natural language commands
- **Reschedule and update** existing calendar events
- **Cancel meetings** when needed
- **Query calendar information** about upcoming meetings
- **Send follow-up communications** via Gmail, WhatsApp, and Telegram
- **Process actionable items** from conversations automatically

The assistant maintains a conversational, friendly tone while being professional and helpful, acting as a personal meeting scheduler that understands context and can handle complex multi-step calendar operations.

## Key Features

### üé§ **Real-Time Voice Interaction**
- **Live voice conversation** with Google Gemini 2.5 Flash Live Preview
- **Intelligent interruption handling** - users can interrupt the assistant mid-sentence
- **Voice Activity Detection (VAD)** with energy thresholds and zero-crossing rate analysis
- **Audio processing optimization** with minimal latency (48kHz to 16kHz conversion)
- **Dual input modes** - supports both voice and text input simultaneously

### üìÖ **Advanced Calendar Management**
- **Google Calendar integration** via Model Context Protocol (MCP)
- **Natural language processing** for complex calendar queries
- **Multi-step operations** - can break down complex requests into actionable steps
- **Intelligent date/time parsing** with IST timezone support
- **CRUD operations** - Create, Read, Update, Delete meetings seamlessly

### üìß **Communication Integration**
- **Gmail integration** for sending emails and checking connection status
- **WhatsApp and Telegram support** (infrastructure ready)
- **Automated follow-up** based on conversation analysis
- **Scheduled messaging** with precise timing control

### üß† **Intelligent Processing**
- **Conversation analysis** using Gemini 2.5 Flash for actionable item extraction
- **Post-processing pipeline** that identifies and executes follow-up actions
- **Context-aware responses** with conversation history maintenance
- **Error handling and retry mechanisms** with exponential backoff

### üèóÔ∏è **Robust Architecture**
- **Microservices architecture** with separate MCP servers for Calendar and Gmail
- **WebSocket-based communication** for real-time interaction
- **PostgreSQL database** for call history and transcript storage
- **Docker containerization** for easy deployment and scaling
- **Resource monitoring** and session management

## Limitations

### üöß **Gemini Voice Model Limitations**
- **Tool calling optimization**: As Gemini voice models are still under development and in experimental phase, tool calling is not very optimized. During tool calling, the tool call execution should ideally run in the background while the agent continues to chat with the user, but this is not handled perfectly by Gemini, resulting in awkward silence before tool responses.

### üîß **Technical Limitations**
- **Single user authentication**: Currently configured for a single user (`sahillukhimultimedia_gmail_com`)
- **Limited communication channels**: WhatsApp and Telegram integrations are placeholder implementations
- **Timezone dependency**: Primarily optimized for IST (Indian Standard Time) timezone
- **Audio quality dependency**: Performance depends on microphone quality and network conditions
- **Concurrent session limits**: Limited by system resources and Gemini API rate limits

### üì± **Platform Limitations**
- **Web browser dependency**: Requires modern browsers with WebRTC support
- **Network requirements**: Needs stable internet connection for real-time voice processing
- **Browser permissions**: Requires microphone access permissions
